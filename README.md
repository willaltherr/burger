# burger
In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

1. What the project does:
In this project we connect to the local server, create a database for burgers and run a fully developed app that adds burgers to a list and then removes them when they are picked up.

2. Why the project is useful:
This project is useful because it teaches us how to build a full-stack site that takes in results from a user and compares their answers to others on the server side.

3. How users can get started with the project:
Users can get started with this project by connecting to their local servers as well as build out their routes needed for the project.

4. Where users can get help with your project:
If users need help with the project then they can go to my repo and review the code.

5. Who maintains and contributes to the project:
This project was maintained and contributed by Will Altherr.  In order for me to complete this project I had to use resources online including other repositories that have completed this project.
